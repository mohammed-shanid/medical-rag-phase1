Acetaminophen (Tylenol, Paracetamol)

DOSAGE:
For adults, the standard acetaminophen dosage is 500-1000mg every 4-6 hours as needed.  The maximum daily dose is 4000mg (4 grams) per day from all sources.  Exceeding this amount can cause severe liver damage. For children, dosing is weight-based: 10-15mg per kilogram every 4-6 hours, not exceeding 5 doses in 24 hours. Always use the measuring device that comes with liquid formulations to ensure accurate dosing.

SIDE EFFECTS: 
Acetaminophen is generally well-tolerated at recommended doses.  Mild side effects may include nausea, stomach pain, loss of appetite, or headache. Serious side effects are rare but include severe allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, trouble breathing). The most serious risk is liver damage from overdose, which can be fatal. Signs of liver damage include yellowing of skin or eyes (jaundice), dark urine, severe fatigue, and abdominal pain.

INTERACTIONS:
Chronic alcohol use (three or more drinks per day) significantly increases the risk of liver damage from acetaminophen. Warfarin (blood thinner) effectiveness may be increased by regular acetaminophen use, requiring closer monitoring of bleeding. Some medications contain hidden acetaminophen (combination cold/flu products), increasing risk of accidental overdose. Isoniazid (tuberculosis medication) may increase liver toxicity risk when combined with acetaminophen. 

CONTRAINDICATIONS: 
Acetaminophen should not be used by people with severe liver disease or active liver failure. Individuals with a known allergy to acetaminophen should avoid it. Use with extreme caution in people with chronic alcohol use disorder due to increased liver damage risk. Those with severe kidney disease may need dose adjustments. 

WARNINGS:
Read labels carefully - many over-the-counter medications contain acetaminophen (cold medicines, sleep aids, pain relievers). Taking multiple products can lead to accidental overdose. Never exceed the maximum daily dose of 4000mg. If you drink three or more alcoholic beverages daily, consult your doctor before taking acetaminophen. Seek immediate medical help if you suspect acetaminophen overdose, even if you feel fine - liver damage can occur without immediate symptoms.  Store acetaminophen out of reach of children, as accidental overdose in children can be fatal.
